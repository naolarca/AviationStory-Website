##The Story Of Aviation

Hello there! I decided to combine two of my passions into one place: computer engineering and aviation. 
I always have many projects, small or big, in my head. Here's the website on The Story Of Aviation!

I don't have a domain yet, but you can either check the code on GitHub by going to the index.html in the TestStory and the jessandruss.us folders, 
or either look at the presentation video where I scroll on my website right here: https://youtu.be/UaTS6LAx4FQ

Thank you so much! 
Hope you enjoy :)
