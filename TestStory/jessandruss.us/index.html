	<meta name="description" content="Since I was a little girl, I was curious about technologies, engineering, science... There was a secret laying behind every objects created by humans and I was curious to know what it was.
	How was it created? how could we be able to fly to another continent in a couple of hours? I became curious on the origin of planes and aviation. So here's a website on the origins of aviation...">
